sentence complexity: maximum depth of the sentence dependency tree which is produced using the spaCy 3.4.2 dependency parser49 (‘Syntactic complexity (depth)’). For the second measure, we adopt an approach similar in nature to the one by Weiss et al.25 who use clause structure to evaluate syntactic complexity.

<todo: think about the features to use>

When analyzing essays for linguistic features, you're essentially examining how language is used in the text. This can involve a wide range of elements, from the basic structure of sentences to the more nuanced use of language to convey tone, style, or argumentative strength. Here are some key linguistic features that are commonly analyzed in essays, along with suggestions on where to find resources or tools for analysis:

### 1. Syntax
- **Sentence Structure**: Analyze the complexity of sentences, including the use of compound and complex sentences, sentence length variation, and the use of passive vs. active voice.
- **Paragraph Structure**: Examine how paragraphs are organized to develop ideas, including the use of topic sentences and coherence across sentences.

### 2. Lexical Features
- **Word Choice (Diction)**: Look at the vocabulary used in the essay, including the use of specific, concrete words vs. general, abstract words, and the presence of jargon or specialized language.
- **Lexical Density and Diversity**: Measure the range and complexity of vocabulary used. Tools like Lexical Complexity Analyzer can help with this.

### 3. Morphology
- **Use of Parts of Speech**: Analyze the frequency and distribution of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. This can give insights into the writer's focus on actions, descriptions, states, etc.

### 4. Semantics
- **Themes and Topics**: Identify key themes and topics discussed in the essay. Text mining and topic modeling tools (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation) can help automate this process.
- **Figures of Speech**: Look for the use of metaphors, similes, personification, etc., which can add depth and richness to the text.

### 5. Pragmatics
- **Speech Acts**: Identify instances of asserting, questioning, commanding, etc., to understand how the author constructs arguments and interacts with the reader.
- **Tone and Politeness Strategies**: Analyze the essay for its tone (formal, informal, persuasive, etc.) and how it addresses and engages the audience.

### 6. Cohesion and Coherence
- **Reference and Substitution**: Examine how well the essay uses linguistic elements to refer to previously mentioned ideas (pronouns, synonyms) and maintain topic continuity.
- **Logical Organization**: Assess the use of connectors and transitional phrases to see how ideas are logically connected.

### Tools and Resources
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tools**: Software like NLTK, SpaCy, or Gensim in Python can help analyze many of these features programmatically.
- **Text Analysis Platforms**: Tools like AntConc or Voyant Tools offer user-friendly interfaces for conducting linguistic analysis without extensive programming knowledge.
- **Academic Databases and Journals**: Look for research articles on linguistic analysis in databases like JSTOR, Google Scholar, or specific linguistics journals for theoretical background and methodological insights.

### Finding Resources
- **Online Courses and Tutorials**: Platforms like Coursera, edX, and Khan Academy offer courses on linguistics and text analysis.
- **Linguistics Textbooks**: Books on linguistics often contain chapters on text analysis and discourse analysis, providing frameworks and examples of how to analyze texts.

When analyzing essays, it's essential to choose features relevant to your specific goals, whether that's understanding the writer's style, evaluating the clarity and coherence of arguments, or assessing the level of language proficiency. Combining several of these features can give a comprehensive view of the essay's linguistic qualities.# neu-nlp6120-final-project-team3
